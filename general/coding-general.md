conventions:
- id: explicit-by-default
  rule: Don't make the reader reconstruct something you could have just stated; every shortcut bills a Reader Tax to whoever reads the code next.
- id: prefer-error-exposing-form
  rule: When two forms produce the same result but one has a silent failure mode, choose the form that exposes the error, even at the cost of verbosity. When it conflicts with explicit-by-default, error-exposing form wins.
- id: no-peer-re-exports
  rule: Import from the authoritative module, not a peer that re-exports it; barrel index files that explicitly aggregate a public surface are the only exception.
- id: tight-scope
  rule: Implement what was asked and nothing more; before adding any function, type, or abstraction, stop at the first rung that already covers it (stdlib, an installed dependency), prefer the framing with the smaller net addition, and treat deletion as progress.
- id: run-verification
  rule: Run the project's verification commands (lint, type-check, build) before finishing.
- id: report-tradeoffs
  rule: Report a tradeoffs block (design_element / cost / alternative / what_is_lost) for any spec or task where implementation cost clearly outweighs the value, rather than implementing or skipping silently.
- id: design-decisions-out-of-scope
  rule: Design decisions (visual direction, layout, UX flows) are out of scope; flag them as a note to the process layer rather than deciding them.
principles:
- id: ask-before-architecture
  rule: When a task involves a structural or DRY question with two reasonable approaches, name both and ask before implementing.
  condition: When implementing a structural change where multiple approaches are plausible — class vs. function extraction, inline vs. extracted helper, etc.
  reason: Architectural questions are cheap to clarify and expensive to implement wrong. One question saves a full round-trip correction and avoids a messy intermediate state the user has to redirect out of.
- id: verify-before-bulk-edit
  rule: Before replace_all or any bulk find-and-replace, grep for all instances and read context around each match to confirm they are all conceptually equivalent.
  condition: Whenever the same string or pattern appears in multiple places and a bulk replacement is tempting.
  reason: Occurrences of the same string are not always the same thing. Bulk replacement without verification creates a syntactically correct but conceptually wrong intermediate state — worse than not having made the change.
- id: grep-subdirs-before-delete
  rule: Before deleting a file flagged as a redundant duplicate, grep for all relative imports/references (including ../ and ../../ variants) across the entire directory subtree, not just sibling files.
  condition: When deleting a file that other files in the same directory tree may reference via relative paths.
  reason: Subdirectories have different relative path depths, so a grep limited to ./ will miss references in nested dirs. The build reveals them, but a wider grep at task start catches them in one pass.
- id: code-lives-at-consumer-level
  rule: Code lives at the level of its narrowest consumer. Something used in one file stays in that file; something used in one module stays in that module. Once a second consumer appears, promote immediately — do not defer. Promote to the lowest common ancestor of its consumers, and place shared code beside the data type or concern it serves.
  condition: When deciding where a function, type, or component should live — at initial placement and at the moment a second consumer appears.
  reason: Premature extraction signals reuse that isn't real, obscures actual scope, and implies candidacy for import when it isn't. One module importing from another's internals creates a hidden peer dependency.
- id: generic-defers-to-consumer
  rule: Generic components expose extension points (parameters, slots, options) and make no assumptions about their caller's context. Any concern specific to a particular use case belongs in the consumer that has that context.
  condition: 'When building any reusable unit that will be composed into more specific ones. Test: could this serve two different contexts with different concerns? If yes, the generic must not bake in either.'
  reason: A generic unit's value is reusability across contexts. Every caller-specific assumption hardcoded into the generic narrows that reusability and hides the dependency from the call site.
- id: two-approaches-then-decide
  rule: When choosing between implementation approaches, evaluate at most two seriously. If still uncommitted after two, pick the simpler one and move forward. Re-deriving the same tradeoffs is not analysis — it's spinning.
  condition: Any time an implementation decision has more than one plausible path and the first attempt was abandoned.
  reason: Iteration is cheaper than deliberation past the second pass. The signal that more exploration is needed is new information, not re-examining the same constraints under a slightly different framing.
- id: unified-representation-no-type-leakage
  rule: Internal type distinctions (draft vs. entry, current vs. historical, variant A vs. B) must not escape into the consumer's data model. A unit that maintains parallel state for two variants should merge them into one unified collection before returning; a storage design where one of N items is 'active' should use an index into a flat list, not a separate slot or key.
  condition: When a unit returns parallel outputs that differ only by an internal type distinction, or when designing state/storage for any system where one of N items is active.
  reason: Leaking the internal distinction forces every consumer to replicate the branching logic. The unit already owns the data; it should own the routing too.
- id: utility-over-guesswork
  rule: When work is deterministic, precision-sensitive, or disproportionately expensive to solve by inference — color/LCH math, date and timezone arithmetic, geometric layout, hashing, unit conversion, and similar — use the project's registered utility for it if one exists. If none exists, propose one as a deterministic shortcut candidate in the handoff rather than solving it by inference every time.
  condition: 'When a task requires computing or verifying a value where getting it right by inference is unreliable, slow, or has recurred across sessions — not for one-off trivial arithmetic. Color is the canonical case: perceptual variants, palette stops, opacity blends over a backdrop, or any case where color relationships need to be derived rather than chosen arbitrarily. In React Native specifically, CSS custom properties are unavailable to component props at runtime (tintColor, tabBarActiveTintColor, inline style.color, etc.) — reference values from a JS token module rather than hardcoding hex literals there.'
  reason: Guessing at a deterministic relationship produces inaccurate results and burns tokens iterating toward something a small script computes exactly for near-zero cost. The same logic applies to any deterministic or repeatedly-recurring computation — the operator can deny a weak candidate cheaply; grinding it out by inference every session cannot be undone.
- id: scripts-over-hand-editing-structured-data
  rule: When generating or modifying structured data files at scale, write a script that produces the output rather than editing the files directly. The script is the artifact; the output file is its build product.
  condition: When a task involves adding, transforming, or regenerating structured data files with more than a handful of entries.
  reason: Hand-editing large structured files is token-expensive, error-prone, and produces an unreviewed intermediate state. A script is idempotent (safe to re-run), captures the generation logic for future modification, and is cheaper to correct than a partially-edited JSON file.
- id: no-single-char-names
  rule: 'Never use single-character variable names. Name what the variable holds: `index` not `i`, `xCoord` not `x`, `error` not `e`. Exception: abbreviations whose meaning is fully determined by universal convention and carries no ambiguity (e.g. two-letter state codes).'
  condition: When naming any variable, parameter, loop counter, catch binding, or destructured value — in any language.
  reason: Single-character names force every reader to reconstruct what the variable holds from surrounding context — the Reader Tax on every read. The convention originated as a program-size constraint that no longer exists; the tradeoff that justified it is gone. Descriptive names also make bulk rename safe; a single-character name appears in unrelated contexts and cannot be safely replaced.
- id: sibling-config-over-consumer-branch
  rule: When N siblings share the same shape — the same set of methods or properties, varying only in their values and logic — model them as an array of config records, each carrying its own logic as functions. The consumer maps over the array; it does not branch on index or type.
  condition: When a consumer has or would have a switch/if-chain over sibling cases (steps, sections, tabs), and each case's logic is self-contained.
  reason: 'A consumer switch grows linearly with siblings and must be updated in two places (the data and the branch) when a sibling is added or changed. A config record concentrates each sibling''s identity and logic in one object; the consumer stays fixed. Adding a sibling is a single-site edit: append to the array.'
- id: terminal-checkpoint-pass
  rule: 'Before considering a working implementation done, resolve the two inline markers written during it. (1) Ceiling comments: when a deliberate limitation was accepted mid-task — a naive algorithm, a linear scan, a global lock — it was marked at the point of writing as `// [limitation]; upgrade to [alternative] when [condition]`; now check every ceiling comment in code touched this session against its named condition, and upgrade or remove it if the condition holds. (2) Identity tags: code written this session that depends on an object''s identity or reference persisting across states — an animated element, a memoized value, a reference-keyed cache entry, an instance-bound subscription — was tagged at the point of writing as `// [depends-on-identity]: <what must stay the same, and why>`; now grep for the tag, verify each against the code that owns that object''s lifecycle, and resolve it: delete once verified, or replace with an assertion or test if the invariant needs protection past this session. Never leave either marker in shipped code.'
  condition: After any implementation reaches a working state (feature correct, checks passing) — at your own terminal checkpoint, immediately before considering the work done. The two inline markers are written at the moment the shortcut or identity dependency is created; this pass is where they get resolved. Structural examination of the diff (stringly-typed contracts, thin wrappers, unnamed blocks, emergent groupings) is a separate fresh-eyes review-pass concern — see the code-review domain's structural-examination.
  reason: 'An inline marker has no compiler: a named upgrade condition or identity assumption silently drifts unless something schedules an actual check of it. Anchoring both checks to one terminal checkpoint — a moment every session actually has, unlike ''the commit'' — is what turns the markers from archival prose into conditions that get evaluated, and bounds an identity tag''s lifetime to a single session: verified and deleted, never trusted at a distance.'
- id: module-boundaries-precede-deployment-separation
  rule: Before splitting code into separately-deployed services or packages, verify that the equivalent module boundaries are already clean in the existing codebase — no cycles, no cross-module access to internals. Deploy the boundary only after the code already respects it.
  condition: When planning a migration from a monolith to microservices, separate repositories, or separately-deployed packages — at the point of deciding whether the split is ready to make.
  reason: Deployment separation enforces physical isolation; it cannot create logical isolation. If module A depends on module B's internal functions rather than its exported API, the same entanglement persists after separation as a network call or inter-package import. The coupling is not resolved — it is made harder to refactor. Physical separation of clean logical boundaries is a deployment decision; separation of entangled code instantiates the coupling as a distributed-systems dependency.
- id: dependency-graph-over-architecture-diagrams
  rule: When auditing or enforcing architectural boundaries, derive them from the actual import/dependency graph of the code, not from architectural diagrams or intent statements.
  condition: When verifying that two modules are genuinely isolated — before any structural separation such as package extraction, service split, or repository division — or when a stated architecture diverges from observed runtime or import behavior.
  reason: An architecture diagram captures intent, not implementation. Two modules can be depicted as isolated boxes with a single interface arrow while one has twelve files importing from eight internal files of the other. The dependency graph is always current; a diagram is only current until the next unreviewed commit. If clean boundaries are the goal, the test is the dependency graph — a diagram that agrees with it is a summary, not evidence.
- id: co-derive-coupled-values-in-one-place
  rule: When two or more values are derived from the same input conditions and must always change together, derive them from a single computation with one branch per input case — never from separate independent conditionals or lookups that happen to key off the same condition.
  condition: Whenever a state/condition maps to more than one dependent output that must stay consistent with each other — a label and the action it describes, a color and the icon that must match it, an error code and its message — and computing them separately risks one being edited without the other.
  reason: Separate conditionals over the same input have no structural link between them; nothing stops one from being edited while the other is missed. Keeping one branch per case, in one place, makes the coupling visible at the point of edit instead of relying on the editor's memory to update both sites.
- id: throwaway-prototype-capture-decision-not-code
  rule: When building throwaway code to answer a design or logic question — does this state model feel right, what should this UI look like — rather than to ship, keep it visibly marked as throwaway and out of the production path. Once the question is answered, capture the verdict and the question it settled as prose (in the handoff, a commit, or the deciding artifact) rather than folding the prototype code itself into the real implementation.
  condition: When a coder- or design-composed spawn builds exploratory code specifically to answer a design or logic question before implementing for real, distinct from ordinary feature implementation.
  reason: Throwaway code optimized for learning fast (no tests, no error handling, no abstractions) is exactly the code most likely to get folded into production once the question is answered and it already 'works' — which then ships the shortcuts that were fine for a one-off spike but aren't fine for the real feature. Capturing the verdict as text, separately from the prototype code, keeps the decision durable without also inheriting quality debt that was never meant to survive.
- id: detect-managed-config-before-edit
  rule: Before editing a config or dotfile another tool may own — shell rc files, generated configs — detect whether it is managed (a symlink into nix/home-manager/chezmoi/a dotfiles repo, or a file carrying a "generated by X" header) or plain (an ordinary writable file). Never edit a managed file's deployed path in place; edit the tool's own source-of-truth instead (the nix module, the chezmoi source file, the dotfiles-repo target the symlink resolves to) and tell the user to re-apply/rebuild.
  condition: Any time a task needs to append or modify a config/dotfile that could plausibly be generated or symlinked by an external config-management tool, before making the edit.
  reason: A managed file is owned by a tool that regenerates or re-links it; editing the deployed path either gets silently reverted on the next rebuild (nix) or, worse, an edit that does a rename()-style write replaces the symlink with a plain file, permanently detaching it from the source of truth without any error. Detecting managed-vs-plain first and routing the edit to the real source avoids both failure modes.
- id: isolate-version-pinned-quirk-in-one-provider
  rule: Isolate a library or platform quirk that must be worked around at the call site — a redeclared style, a defensive option, a version-specific incantation — into ONE provider (a constant, helper, hook, or wrapper) that normalizes the behavior; call sites inherit it and never repeat the workaround.
  condition: When the same library or platform workaround appears at more than one call site, or when a version-pinned keeper comment would otherwise sit inline at a call site rather than at one owning definition.
  reason: A workaround copy-pasted across call sites drifts — one site is fixed on a dependency bump and the others are missed. One provider gives the pin one home, makes every call site inherit the fix, and collapses duplicate docs to one.
